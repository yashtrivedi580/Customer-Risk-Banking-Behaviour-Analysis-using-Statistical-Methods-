# Customer Risk & Banking Behaviour Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer risk and banking behavior** using **statistical methods and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a real-world, messy banking dataset.

The objective is to clean raw financial data, handle missing values and outliers, analyze customer financial patterns, and generate insights useful for **credit risk assessment and banking decision-making**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
A bank wants to understand customer behavior, credit risk, and demographic patterns using real-world data containing missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

The task involves:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Statistical analysis  
- Visualization of insights  
- Preparing data for future modeling

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Rows:** 1000  
- **Columns:** 15  
- **Domain:** Banking & Finance  

Key features include:
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, City)
- Financial metrics (Account Balance, Monthly Income, Loan Amount)
- Credit indicators (Credit Score, Late Payments)
- Behavioral data (Transaction Count, Employment Status)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Statistical Methods**

## 🔍 Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values using **mean/median imputation**
- Standardized categorical variables (Gender, City, Loan Status)
- Converted numeric-like columns to correct data types

### 2. Outlier Detection & Treatment
- **IQR Method**
- **Winsorization (1st–99th percentile)**
- Median replacement for extreme values

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics
- Distribution analysis (Histogram, Boxplot, Density plots)
- Skewness & kurtosis analysis
- Correlation analysis between financial variables

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Account balance and income distributions were heavily right-skewed
- Customers with low credit scores showed higher late payment behavior
- Monthly income strongly correlated with account balance
- Outlier treatment improved data stability and interpretability

---

## 📁 Project Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset
- Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA & statistical analysis
- Visualizations and summary insights

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Predictive modeling for credit risk
- Customer segmentation
- Dashboard creation using Power BI / Tableau
